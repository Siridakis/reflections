When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

It's always good to have a copy of important files in the cloud, in case anything
happens to the local files storage system (like, data corruption or your HD being
stolen or destroyed)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

That's a tough one for me. One good reason would be when working in a group and
more than one person commits something in the same branch, this could lead to
conflicts. The other reason would be thinking the other way around. If you create
new files or make new commits locally and don't push them yet, would a automatically
up-to-date remote repository delete those files because they are not in the remote?

use one instead of another?
